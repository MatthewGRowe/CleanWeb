APIs are online data resources that you can access. Some are available and open with no restrictions, most require a "key" and a "secret" a bit like a password and username.  To get these you will need to create an account with the provider.  

The environment changes from Winforms to ASP/MVC after tutorial 1.  This is far more complex but the end result is worth the effort.

This section can be a bit intimidating, read through the tutorials in order, watch the available YouTube content.

C# is used for these projects and we work in MS Visual Studio.
