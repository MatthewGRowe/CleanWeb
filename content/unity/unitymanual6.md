# Overview - Sounds:

This guide will introduce you to Object Oriented Programming and the concept of classes.  An AudioManager is used which will enable you to access your sounds library from anywhere in your game.

To use this guide you will need to download and install Unity and MS Visual Studio. It is recommended that you install the latest versions.  Some of the screenshots in this guide have been taken from older versions but should not differ too much.  

Simply use this guide as a self-guided classroom / training room resource.  It has been written in MS Word so you can use it as is, or you can edit  as appropriate. [^*]
